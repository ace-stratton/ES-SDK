THIS REPO IS INCLUDED IN MANY PROJECTS, SO DO NOT ADD GLOBAL TYPES WITH NAMES LIKE "tStatus", "Status_t", "Stack" etc. AS GLOBAL NAMES LIKE STRUCTURE NAMES, ENUM NAMES, ENUM CONSTANTS AND ELSE!!! 
USE UNIQUE/PROPER PREFIX

This repo contains software stacks for satellite module to module communication as well as module to GS communication.
Version 1 (whatever this is, currently not bound to anything)
Modules that use it, should include this repo as sub-repository with name "ESPLATFORM_NETWORK_STACK".
